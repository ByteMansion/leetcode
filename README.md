# Solutions to Leetcode Problems
This repo aims at documenting solutions to Leetcode problems or related algorithms.
Another repo also includes hundreds of solutions, but it is a large projects and not
convenient to look up a certain solution. Therefore, I created this repo to split solutions 
one by one.
